# Kalman-Filters
My personal learning and work during my graduate school independent study with Dr. Diego Mesa. I would like to thank Dr. Mesa for his guidance.

This work is far from polished or complete but I wanted to display my learning on a niche subject. 

This work is based off of https://www.bzarg.com/p/how-a-kalman-filter-works-in-pictures/
as well as https://filterpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/kalman/KalmanFilter.html
